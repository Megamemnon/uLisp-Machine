## edlin

I remember a line editor in DOS called edlin, so I called this program the same name. This editor doesn't require any control over the cursor position. You run it and start entering lines. It provides the line numbers, for your reference, but line numbers aren't included in the 'document'.

edlin is invoked with an optional single parameter which is expected to be a list of strings and returns a list of strings.

Instead of typing in a new line, you can issue a command to edlin...

### (e line) Edit line 

edlin will display line \[line\] for your reference and let you enter new content for that line number

### (d line)

edlin will delete the specified line number

### (i beforeline)

edlin will prompt you for a new line of text and insert that line before the specified line number

### (k startline)

lists 5 lines starting with startline

### (l) List

lists all lines for your reading pleasure

### (x) Exit

Quit edlin.
